# Odin-Calculator

A basic calculator made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

The calculator includes basic mathematical operations, and works by having slots for the left operand, operator and right operand, and evaluating them all at once, storing the result in the left operand for further calculations.

Done as the final project of the `Foundations` course, this project combines everything learned so far, and requires a good grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
